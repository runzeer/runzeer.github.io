I received the M.A. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST). I joined the State Key Laboratory of High-end Server & Storage Technology (HSSLAB) in Inspur last year.

## Research

I am really interested in the computer vision. In M.A., I put my main focus on National Naked-eye 3D progam. I mainly undertook the task for 2D-to-3D conversion for the monocular camera equipments.

Now in HSSLAB, I paid more attention to the mainstream conputer vision area, especially deep learning, such as object detection, instance segmentation as well as person Re-ID

## Awards

- The 7th for the LVIS Instance Segmentation.(ICCV2019 workshop)
